      <p>
        I’m a full stack Software Engineer passionate about fighting climate change. Known for producing high quality code, collaborating with product and design, and thorough PR reviews, I learn quickly, and pride myself on providing great customer service to both neighboring teams and end users.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have experience with TypeScript, React, Python, Ruby, PostgreSQL, HTTP, Docker, Go, and AWS. I recently built <a class="waypost" href="https://waypost-io.github.io/">Waypost</a>, an open-source feature flag management platform that specializes in A/B testing.
